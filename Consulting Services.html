<h2>BlockChain</h2>
<p>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked using cryptography.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data.It is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.</p>

<h2>Autonomous Things (AuT)</h2>
<p>Autonomous things, abbreviated AuT, or the Internet of autonomous things, abbreviated as IoAT, is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.AuT technologies share many common traits, which justify the common notation. They are all based on recent breakthroughs in the domains of machine learning and artificial intelligence.They all require extensive and prompt regulatory developments to specify the requirements from them and to license and manage their deployment. And they all require unprecedented levels of safety (e.g., automobile safety) and security,to overcome concerns about the potential negative impact of the new technology.</p>

<h2>Immersive Experiences</h2>
<p>Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being physically present in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment.The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.  </p>
