<h2>Algeria</h2>
<img src="algeria.jpg.jpeg" alt="Algeria" class="center">
<p>Africaâ€™s largest country lies just a short hop from Europe. The north, with its snow-flecked mountains and stunning coastline, is home to urbane and charismatic cities such as Algiers and Constantine, as well as some of the most magnificent Roman sites in existence including Timgad and Djemila, both vast, perfectly preserved Roman towns with barely another tourist in sight.</p>
