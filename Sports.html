<h2>Soccer</h2>
<img src="ManCity.png" class="center">
<p>The soccer team that I support is Manchester City, they're a football club based in Manchester,England.</p>
<p>They've won the Premier League three times,in 2012,2014 and most recently in 2018. I hope we will win it again this year but we face considerable pressure from Liverpool FC</p>
<p>Our best players are Sergio Aguero, the record goalscorer for the club, Kevin De Bruyne, one of the most-feared playmakers in world football. More recently,Bernardo Silva has been a revelation, cementing himself as a starter and arguably one of the world's best and most complete footballers  </p>
